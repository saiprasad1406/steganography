# steganography
**Image Steganography Tool**: This Python tool hides and retrieves text messages within images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. Features include text embedding, extraction, and a simple GUI using Tkinter. It employs Pillow and NumPy for image processing. Future plans: message encryption and support for more image formats.
